A list of packages that extend Matplotlib.  These are maintained 
and distributed independently from Matplotlib so go to the website 
listed for instructions.  

Please contribute your package by opening a pull-request at 
https://github.com/matplotlib/mpl-third-party and create a new yml
file from the template there and we will add you to the list.  

If you need help making a package, see 
https://github.com/matplotlib/mpl-cookiecutter-package, where we give you 
a template to make it easy!
