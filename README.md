# mpl-user-contrib
List of matplotlib user-contributed packages.  These are served at <http://matplotlib.org/mpl-user-contrib.html>

To add your package to the list create a YAML file `your-cool-mpl-package.yml` with the following fields:

```yml
github: https://github.com/yourname/your-cool-mpl-package/
keywords:  stylefiles, helper functions
description:  A less-than 50-word description of your package that will help other users find it.
```

Either fork this repo and add the new file to the `packages` directory,
or use the `Add File` button above, and then create a PR.

Note that the name of the yml and the name of the repo should ideally match.
